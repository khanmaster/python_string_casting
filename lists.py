# Data collection

# Java Array in python Lists are same as arrays
# both serve the same purpose of storing data
# why list? - manage data - access data in order - it give us the option to add, remove etc.

# Syntax of list: [list] square brackets (tuple) {dictionary - key:value}
# Tuples are immutable -

# Let's create a list of cities

# cities = ["Tokyo", "Paris", "Prague", "Luxumberge"]
# display (print()) list the cities
#print(cities)
#print(type(cities))

#print(cities[3])
#print(cities[1])
# cities[1] = "Amsterdam" # this will replace city in index 3
# print(cities)
#
# cities.append("Vilnius") # adds the city at the end of the string
# print(cities)


# cities = ["Tokyo", "Paris", "Prague", "Luxumberge"]
# cities.pop()
# print(cities)
#
#
# cities.insert(3,"London")
# print(cities)
#

mix_type_string = [[1, 2, 3], ["one", "two", "three"]]

string_list = ["one", "two", "three"]

print(string_list + mix_type_string)
# print(mix_type_string[1])
