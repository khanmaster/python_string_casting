# # what are sets - sets are very similar to Lists
# # What's the difference - sets are unordered
#
# # Syntax:- we use {} brackets
#
# # Let's create a set
#
# car_par = {"wheels", "windows", "doors"}
# print(car_par)
#
# # what can we do with sets
# # add an item to the set
# car_par.add("seats")
# print(car_par)
#
# # deleting an item
# car_par.discard("windows")
# print(car_par)

# Frozen set

# Syntax- () store them in a variable

counting = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(type(counting))

# Let's move onto for loops
